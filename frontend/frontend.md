- **Framework**: React 19.1.1 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Create React App 5.0.1
- **Styling**: CSS3 (App.css)
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API (built-in)
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Setup ✅
- React application bootstrapped with Create React App
- TypeScript configuration enabled
- Testing framework configured (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Basic project structure established
- Development server configuration

{
  "@testing-library/dom": "^10.4.1",
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.8.0",
  "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",
  "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",

}
```

## Available Scripts

### Development
- **`npm start`** - Runs the app in development mode on http://localhost:3000
- **`npm test`** - Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode
- **`npm run build`** - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
- **`npm run eject`** - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)

## Planned Features (To Be Implemented)

### 1. Main Photo Gallery 📸
- Grid-based photo display with responsive design
- Thumbnail loading with lazy loading optimization
- Infinite scroll or pagination for large collections
- Photo selection and bulk operations
- Sorting options (date, name, labels)

### 2. Image Upload Interface 📤
- Drag-and-drop upload area
- File selection dialog
- Upload progress indicators
- Image preview before upload
- Batch upload support
- File type and size validation

### 3. Search & Filter System 🔍
- Natural language search input
- Real-time search suggestions
- Filter by labels/tags
- Advanced search options
- Search history
- Saved searches

### 4. Image Detail View 🖼️
- Full-size image display
- Image metadata display
- Generated labels/tags
- Detailed AI-generated descriptions
- Edit/delete options
- Share functionality

### 5. User Interface Components
- Navigation header with PhotoMind branding
- Responsive sidebar for filters
- Modal dialogs for image details
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## API Integration Plan

### Backend Communication
The frontend will communicate with the Flask backend at `http://localhost:5000` using the following endpoints:

```typescript
// API endpoints to be integrated
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';

const endpoints = {
  upload: `${API_BASE_URL}/upload`,
  search: `${API_BASE_URL}/search`, 
  gallery: `${API_BASE_URL}/gallery`,
  imageDetails: (id: string) => `${API_BASE_URL}/image/${id}`,
  thumbnail: (id: string) => `${API_BASE_URL}/thumbnail/${id}`
};
```

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local component state
- Context API for global state (user preferences, search filters)
- Custom hooks for API calls and data fetching

## Component Architecture Plan

### Planned Component Hierarchy
```
App
├── Header
│   ├── Logo
│   ├── SearchBar
│   └── UserMenu
├── Sidebar
│   ├── FilterPanel
│   └── UploadButton
├── MainContent
│   ├── Gallery
│   │   ├── PhotoGrid
│   │   └── PhotoCard
│   ├── ImageDetail (Modal)
│   └── UploadModal
└── Footer
```

### Component Responsibilities
- **App**: Main application container, routing, global state
- **Header**: Navigation, search, branding
- **Sidebar**: Filters, upload trigger, navigation
- **Gallery**: Photo grid display, selection handling
- **PhotoCard**: Individual photo thumbnail with metadata
- **ImageDetail**: Full-size image view with details
- **UploadModal**: File upload interface

## Styling Approach

### CSS Strategy
- CSS Modules or Styled Components for component-scoped styles
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- CSS Custom Properties for theming
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Design System
- Consistent color palette
- Typography scale
- Spacing system
- Component variants (primary, secondary, etc.)
- Dark/light theme support

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
1. Navigate to frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

### Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write unit tests for components
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Implement responsive design
- Add proper error boundaries
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility

## Testing Strategy

### Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow testing (future)

### Testing Tools
- Jest for test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- User Event for interaction simulation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Image lazy loading for gallery
- Virtual scrolling for large photo collections
- Image compression and WebP format support
- Code splitting for route-based chunks
- Service worker for offline functionality (future)

### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Image optimization in build process

## Accessibility Features

### Planned Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for modals
- Alt text for all images
- ARIA labels and roles

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- ES6+ features with Babel transpilation
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- PWA capabilities (offline support, install prompt)
- Real-time updates with WebSocket
- Advanced image editing tools
- Social sharing features
- Collaborative albums
- AI-powered photo organization suggestions

### Performance Improvements
- Image CDN integration
- Advanced caching strategies
- Background sync for uploads
- Prefetching for better UX

## Current Status
The frontend is currently in the initial setup phase with the default Create React App template. The next development phase will involve:

1. Setting up the component architecture
2. Implementing the photo gallery interface
3. Creating the upload functionality
4. Integrating with the backend API
5. Adding search and filter capabilities
6. Implementing the detailed image view

The application is ready for active development and can be extended with the PhotoMind-specific features outlined in this documentation.
